Hi,

</I>Thanks for providing.

&gt;<i> In fed2 console output you cannot see any &quot;Reflection Received:&quot; message.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;provideAttributeValueUpdate:&quot; message is not displayed in fed1 or fed2.
</I>The provideAttributeValueUpdate is not called because you never call 
RTIambassador::requestAttributeValueUpdate(..).
Note that the variant for the object class is also not wired up as of now.
The object instance variant should work. I am heavily relying on this in an 
other project.

&gt;<i> If you uncomment code for sync point management in
</I>&gt;<i> ExampleCPPFederate.cpp and start both federates before hitting &quot;Enter&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> they both receive &quot;Reflection Received:&quot; callback.
</I>Ok, there are more such reflect callbacks than the two you used. And yes there 
is a pending problem with timestamped message delivery which of these 
callbacks to use. I am currently working on improoving the timestamped queue 
and the behavior of the ambassador with respect to interaction and attribute 
order types.

But your example, if you uncomment the user interaction, you will just have 
one federate that sends the messages (interactions and attribute updates) 
while the other federate is not yet subscribed for this. Then you sleep for 
some time while the second federate gets the chance to subscribe. But past 
that point no messages are sent anymore by the first federate. the only 
persistent state that the second federate gets then is the existence of the 
object itself. And that one is correctly propagated to the second federate.

So, I think this is correct. OpenRTI queues messages in the receiving federate 
for later delivery. Also there is this publish - subscribe model which ensures 
that the rti does not need to send messages to a federate that is not 
interrested in these. So, if you send the messages as long as the other 
federate is not suscribed, it will not receive these.

You may experience a different problem with your application?

&gt;<i> Thanks. Looks like OpenRTI contains pretty much everything I need for now.
</I>That's good to hear.

Greetings

Mathias
