Hi,

</I>
Ownership management, regions and message delivery/subscription combined with 
regions, the advisory switches and save and restore are not implemented as of 
today. Then a lot of specialities of rti1516e are missing in the server 
backend. That will come, but I do not have a time estimate for that.
