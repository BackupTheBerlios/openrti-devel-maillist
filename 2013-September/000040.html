I am sorry, but you are hard to understand, so I do not exactly understand 
your problem.

In general, time management seems to solve this kind of problem. If you 
require message to be delivered the appropriate interaction class and 
attribute needs to be reliable instead of best effort. Also you need to make 
sure that the receiving federate is subscribed once you send these messages. 
Else you get a race between subscription and sending these messages and not 
receive the first ones. I think you correctly describe the way of information 
from A-&gt;B. If you need the back channel, the recommended way to get this is to 
make both time regulating and constrained, then you get the two way time stamp 
based synchronization.

Other than that I think that a solution to your problem depends more on what 
you are trying to achieve at a higher level?

Greetings

Mathias
