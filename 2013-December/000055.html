Hi,

</I>Well, this is the whole point of all the prefix directories that you find in 
about any non trivial software out there.

But I agree that it would be nice to have this. You may want to look at the 
patch attached to <A HREF="http://bugs.python.org/issue18309">http://bugs.python.org/issue18309</A> which tries to implement 
this for python.
Anyway the code used in this python change is not available on any 
architecture so, the fallback should be looking up that path in the build time 
configured prefix.
If not found at this point, you could fall back to a blob just baken hard into 
the librti1516e. That would work in any case. Since this file is just taken 
without modification from the standard and since this described scheme allows 
overriding it, having a last resort immutable baken into the library should be 
ok.

And no, putting a relative path into the rti1516e binary without something 
like the python patch to find the mom file as suggested converts OpenRTI from 
'just works if installed correctly' to 'only works if your application has a 
certain current working directory set'. Which would be a giant step back for 
usability.

For your comment on DESTDIR above, you might want to understand how this is 
supposed to be used. DESTDIR is for software installer packagers. Almost any 
(sensible?) software using cmake or autotools use the install prefix to wire up 
the right install paths and most often compile in paths that point to this 
directories. DESTDIR is set by rpmbuild for example to configure in the path 
where the package gets unpacked when installing the rpm, but install this stuff 
for packaging into a temporary root directory. Given that you might realize 
that allmost all software packages that you can find in a prepacked rpm for use 
with a linux distribution behaves that way - So, I assume it is wise to 
support this somehow common pattern :-)
So, if you wildly set DESTDIR for your handmade installation process your 
probably lost with a lot of software out there ...

&gt;<i> i.e. if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is changed in a second run of CMake
</I>&gt;<i> then OPENRTI_DATAROOTDIR did not get update.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is due, to the fact that OPENRTI_DATAROOTDIR is defined as a CACHE var:
</I>&gt;<i> SET(OPENRTI_DATAROOTDIR &quot;${CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_DATAROOTDIR}/OpenRTI&quot; CACHE
</I>&gt;<i> PATH &quot;Path where OpenRTI puts runtime required paths.&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So even after I changed CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX the initial default value
</I>&gt;<i> stays in cache:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> $ grep &quot;/usr/local&quot; CMakeCache.txt
</I>&gt;<i> OPENRTI_DATAROOTDIR:PATH=/usr/local/share/OpenRTI
</I>Ok, I see, so I have removed OPENRTI_DATAROOTDIR to be an option and rather 
than that just be hard set by the install prefix.
Having this a seperate option seems to be counter productive.

I personally work mostly with scripts and these obviously get everything as 
intended from their first call. So I never run into this probably very common 
trap for interactive cmake use.
Do I have more of these spread over the build system?
If so, let me know.

Thanks for pointing this out.

Greetings

Mathias
