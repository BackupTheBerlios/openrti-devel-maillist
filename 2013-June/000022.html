Hi,

How do you inegrate with matlab?
Is that something generic, like an s-function interface to hla object or a 1:1 
generic matlab binding to the rti interface. Or is that something application 
specific for your particular needs?
You do go the java route or the c++ route?

&gt;<i> What happens is: I developed  a code for IEEE 1516-2010 which works

</I>&gt;<i> However, unless my university pays for the academic version I cannot use

</I>Ok.

&gt;<i> I tried to use the last version of Portico 2.0 . It is a great version in

</I>&gt;<i> without success because it crashes at the beginning of creatingRTI. Seems

</I>You are on windows, right?

&gt;<i> I&#180;m not expert in c++ but I have some knowledge and maybe I&#180;m facing other
</I>&gt;<i> difficulties.
</I>You tried to integrate the c++ api into matlab or the java api?

&gt;<i> So I decided to choose another RTI but most of them are older version of
</I>&gt;<i> IEEE and than I had to rewrite the code which will extend my time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I selected OpenRTI  because it has the latest version 2010 , which maybe
</I>&gt;<i> compatible to my code to try to integrate it to matlab.
</I>The rti1516e binding is in a very experimental state. I have this basicall 
running with some simple examples but, we might unleach some of the api 
functions under some conditions. A lot of rti1516e api functions are currently 
just switched off since they were extended somehow for the update rates for 
example. For that reason these functions do currently only emit an internal 
error. But they could work just like the rti1516 interface if only used with 
the capabilities of rti1516.

&gt;<i> Now the problem is that Open RTI needs to be compiled and I believe that
</I>&gt;<i> uses Cmake list ( I use Cmake-gui 2.8) but I tried to use it and I got some
</I>&gt;<i> error messages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So please, can you help me to explain on how to compile it correctly?  I
</I>&gt;<i> need lib files and dlls as well.
</I>
I assume you are on windows since you mention cmake-gui.
Start cmake-gui, enter a build directory and the source directory.
Select a generator, press configure and generate. Then use visual c to compile 
the code.

&gt;<i> Also I need to know if I can compile with gcc mingwin.
</I>Currently mingw is untested and due to the cyclic link dependency of the rti 
abi most probably does not compile. Neither does cygwin. Visual c should work, 
at least I regularily compile and test this here on a virtual machine.
What is missing is some adjustments to the build system to do the same kind of 
tricks OpenRTI already does with visual c.

At this moment I try to build a next windows test setup with mingw installed. 
So, that should not be too much work, but without a test setup here, I guess 
we will not have too much luck ...

Appart from that, it would be interresting to know how you interface with the 
rti api. The choice of the compiler together with matlab can lead to more or 
less problems if you try to integrate something.

What compiler do you use for the integration of the commertial rti into 
matlab?

Greetings

Mathias
