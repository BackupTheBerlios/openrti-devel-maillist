Hi,

</I>
So, for the mex integration I would vote for a visual c build.
The compiler should match what matlab tells you to use.

&gt;<i> I decided to look for more options and I found GERTICO from FraunHffer
</I>&gt;<i> Institute and OLHA0.5 but but developed only the HLA 1516-2000. There&#180;s no

</I>&gt;<i> 1516-2010 but
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea on how to compile correctly. I need the dlls and libs.
</I>I used the following batch script to get an OpenRTI build for some tests on 
the win32 machine. Standing in the buid directory and havig the sources given 
on the command line:

cmake S:\path\to\src\OpenRTI
cmake --build .

But you may use an other variant as you might have installed cmake withoout 
being in the path. Also having the need to select between different cmake 
generators might change the equation.

&gt;<i> Gcc is another issue. I&#180;m trying to integrate with OMNET simulator which is
</I>&gt;<i> an opensource for telecom network. The problem is that this opensource is
</I>&gt;<i> compatible only with GCC instead of visual c++. I made an experience trying
</I>&gt;<i> to use Portico but I got some error messages in the header files which are
</I>&gt;<i> part of the standard. So I may have to modify them or compile the whole
</I>&gt;<i> code with GCC. The commercial version of OMNET is called OMNEST and has
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility with MS visual C++ and besides, ... it has HLA as well.
</I>I did not find time to look into the gcc windows build.
Which mingw variant are you using? The 32 bits version or the 64 bits version. 
Which compiler version? together with msys or with cygwin?
Or dou you cross compile from linux?

&gt;<i> I&#180;ll send the messages that I&#180;m getting.
</I>That would be good to know.

Greetings
