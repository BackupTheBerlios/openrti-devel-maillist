<PRE>Mathias:

 Thanks for your reply.

I&#180;m studying Smart Grids and I&#180;m planning to develop an integration among
simulators like matlab and omnet using the standard.

What happens is: I developed  a code for IEEE 1516-2010 which works
perfectly with a comercial version of RTI (Pitch and Mak technologies).
However, unless my university pays for the academic version I cannot use
for only two federates.

I tried to use the last version of Portico 2.0 . It is a great version in
java and C++ wrapper but I spent 3 months trying to integrate with matlab
without success because it crashes at the beginning of creatingRTI. Seems
that it was using matlab memory allocation and I tried to debug it without
success.

I&#180;m not expert in c++ but I have some knowledge and maybe I&#180;m facing other
difficulties.

So I decided to choose another RTI but most of them are older version of
IEEE and than I had to rewrite the code which will extend my time.

I selected OpenRTI  because it has the latest version 2010 , which maybe
compatible to my code to try to integrate it to matlab.

Now the problem is that Open RTI needs to be compiled and I believe that
uses Cmake list ( I use Cmake-gui 2.8) but I tried to use it and I got some
error messages.

So please, can you help me to explain on how to compile it correctly?  I
need lib files and dlls as well.

Also I need to know if I can compile with gcc mingwin.


Sincerely

Andre Nudel
