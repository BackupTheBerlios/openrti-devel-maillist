Hi,

</I>These types are available in plain c for a longer time.
So this is the reason I do reference them without the std:: qualifier, actually 
in the file in question I do have Types.h included which cares exactly for this 
issue and puts appropriate types into the OpenRTI namespace.
Definitely, VS2010 should work! Even older ones.
Even if I did not find the time to double check each windows compiler variant 
yesterday.
So, you are telling me that it does no longer compile with older Windows 
compilers?

Actually, the implementation basically works even on older *NIX variants and 
before releases I test on different windows flavours including your variant, 
linux variants back to redhat enterprise 4, solaris 10 intel and sparc and at 
the time I still had a HP-PA risc machine in access it worked even there and I 
still hope that I did not manage to break this. Macos is regularily tested by 
somebody different and somebody ported to android some time ago. Even if I have 
to admit that I do not test this and thus am not sure if it still works.
One test on the other end includes c++11 on gcc to make sure that the backend 
libraries also compile with more modern compilers. 

So, I *do* care for portability. And I do consider this to be a critical 
feature for an RTI implementation - therefore no boost!
If your favourite os is missing, then tell me!

&gt;<i> I were afraid you wouldn't like Boost.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a big fan actually. :-)
</I>Well, I also use boost for some stuff where portability is not such a huge 
concern.

&gt;<i> I personally consider Boost as a C++ pre-standard and it supports a very
</I>&gt;<i> wide range of platforms and compilers.
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, Boost makes some features of the latest C++ standard
</I>&gt;<i> available to older compilers.
</I>&gt;<i> That's the case for fixed width integer types (boost::uint8_t,
</I>&gt;<i> boost::uint32_t, ...).
</I>See the above. It's about easy to get that right!

&gt;<i>  From my point of view, for an OpenSource RTI implementation,
</I>&gt;<i> multi-platform support is more important than depending on a 3rd party
</I>&gt;<i> library.
</I>Really, I already had cases where boost did not allow me to compile with the 
compiler of my choice. At that time I decided not to use boost in anything 
that I want to have portable. Also wrt this, boost is highly version sensitive 
with their usage. That means what do you do when your library A needs boost 
somehow older and your application for some reason the newest released 
version. The library like does not compile with the new variant that your 
application needs. So your only chance is to try to isolate the somehow 
overlapping symbols by their visibility. But this is not exactly easy to get 
and only possible if there is no common api that use both boost. Which is 
likely since you use boost. Then you are blocked out with one use of boost.

Seriously I am looking forward that I can count on c++11. But for the 
portability reason this will be some years until then. But for most things I 
miss there I *do* already have a portable solution so why should I introduce 
any new dependency?
An other reason that I often observe with boost usage is just syntactic 
shugar, which is no reason to pick up a dependency.

Realize, software is *not* there for the programmer it is there to solve a 
problem. And If I can solve this problem with simpler means I will not use the 
more complex one just for fun.
This does not just help for dependencies, that very often helps also for 
readability. And very often also for efficiency.
For readability I am not talking about you reading your own code where you are 
used to the style even if you don't remember the time you writ this piece of 
code. I am talking about very different people that may need to understand this 
code and that may not even be that experienced with boost. So every c/c++ 
programmer understands a for loop, but not everybody out there knows 
BOOST_FOREACH. So, the only advantage of that macro is to type mostly less 
then ten fewer characters but the backside is that it's only claimed to be 
more readable to frequent boost users and less readable to everybody else.
For this one don't tell me that the evaluation of the end iterator is pulled 
out of the loop in these macros. I consider this just basic c++ knowledge that 
you have thought about this problem. And that you also know where it is 
sensible to care for that. I could easily go into more detail if you want...

&gt;<i> But anyway you are the boss! Do as you wish.
</I>I *do* want to be portable and I do not see something critical that I cannot 
just get within a few minutes of thinking that I urgently need and that boost 
delivers.

&gt;<i> &gt; Please use spaces for indenting. Tabs are editor dependent and if you do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not want to see screwed up indenting in some editors the only way to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guarantee indenting not going wild over time in an open source project is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to avoid tabs completely. OpenRTI currently uses 2 spaces for and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indenting level.
</I>&gt;<i> My apologies. Bad Visual Studio habits.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll try to pay more attention to that in the future.
</I>Sounds like nitpicking form my side, but its in the end years or experience 
with that kind of stuff. Even if you now deliver consistent tab indented code, 
I already see the day where somebody with a different editor loads this and 
puts lines with spaces in between. Then we find at least one editor out there 
where it looks bad.

Sure, I should document that somewhere public.

But thanks in any case!

Greetings

Mathias
