<PRE>Hi,

Le 26/11/2013 20:22, Mathias Fr&#246;hlich a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I went ahead and committed a slightly more paranoid version of your fix to the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenRTI-0.4 release branch.
</I>
Thanks.
I will try it first time tomorrow.
But I am a bit concerned about your usage of fixed width integer types 
(|uint8_t, ||uint32_t, ...).
These types have been introduced in C++11.
Few compilers support this standard.
What are your goals in terms of multi-platform support ?
I need to use OpenRTI in a project using older compilers.
Visual Studio 2010 must be supported.|

&gt;<i> I am also glad to find the second part with the tests!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if I have some issues with this part:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The test uses boost. OpenRTI does not need boost and I do not intent to
</I>&gt;<i> require boost. Even not in a test. I do want to have a bare minimum of
</I>&gt;<i> requirements for all of OpenRTI.
</I>&gt;<i> For the random numbers either use the libc variants which are about sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> or use the OpenRTI::Rand class recently committed to the master version. Since
</I>&gt;<i> I would only commit the tests to the development mainline anyway, this should
</I>&gt;<i> be sufficient.
</I>I were afraid you wouldn't like Boost.
I'm a big fan actually. :-)
I personally consider Boost as a C++ pre-standard and it supports a very 
wide range of platforms and compilers.
In addition, Boost makes some features of the latest C++ standard 
available to older compilers.
That's the case for fixed width integer types (boost::uint8_t, 
boost::uint32_t, ...).
 From my point of view, for an OpenSource RTI implementation,
multi-platform support is more important than depending on a 3rd party 
library.
But anyway you are the boss! Do as you wish.

&gt;<i> Please use spaces for indenting. Tabs are editor dependent and if you do not
</I>&gt;<i> want to see screwed up indenting in some editors the only way to guarantee
</I>&gt;<i> indenting not going wild over time in an open source project is to avoid tabs
</I>&gt;<i> completely. OpenRTI currently uses 2 spaces for and indenting level.
</I>My apologies. Bad Visual Studio habits.
I'll try to pay more attention to that in the future.
&gt;<i> The wchar_t HLAunicodeString does not work on linux where
</I>&gt;<i>    sizeof(wchar_t) == 4.
</I>&gt;<i> Consequently the 32 bits wchar_t values do not fit into a HLAunicodeChar value
</I>&gt;<i> and are consequently not restored correctly after the encode/decode cycle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And finally it would be great if the test is added to the list of of executed
</I>&gt;<i> tests of the ctest target using the ADD_TEST cmake macro.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Greetings
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mathias
</I>
Greetings
Jeremy
